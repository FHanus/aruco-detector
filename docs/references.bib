abstract = {Adopting a new technology (exoskeletal vest designed to support overhead work) in the workplace can be challenging since the technology may pose unexpected safety and health consequences. A prototype exoskeletal vest was evaluated for potential unexpected consequences with a set of evaluation tests for: usability (especially, donning & doffing), shoulder range of motion (ROM), postural control, slip & trip risks, and spine loading during overhead work simulations. Donning/doffing the vest was easily done by a wearer alone. The vest reduced the max. shoulder abduction ROM by ∼10%, and increased the mean center of pressure velocity in the anteroposterior direction by ∼12%. However, vest use had minimal influences on trip-/slip-related fall risks during level walking, and significantly reduced spine loadings (up to ∼30%) especially during the drilling task. Use of an exoskeletal vest can be beneficial, yet the current evaluation tests should be expanded for more comprehensiveness, to enable the safe adoption of the technology.}

ABSTRACT = {Background: The loss of arm function is a common and disabling outcome after stroke. Robot-assisted upper limb (UL) training may improve outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of robot-assisted training using end-effector and exoskeleton robots on UL function following a stroke in real-life clinical practice. Methods: A total of 105 patients affected by a first-ever supratentorial stroke were enrolled in 18 neurorehabilitation centers and treated with electromechanically assisted arm training as an add-on to conventional therapy. Both interventions provided either an exoskeleton or an end-effector device (as per clinical practice) and consisted of 20 sessions (3/5 times per week; 6–8 weeks). Patients were assessed by validated UL scales at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1), and at three-month follow-up (T2). The primary outcome was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the upper extremity (FMA-UE). Results: FMA-UE improved at T1 by 6 points on average in the end-effector group and 11 points on average in the exoskeleton group (p < 0.0001). Exoskeletons were more effective in the subacute phase, whereas the end-effectors were more effective in the chronic phase (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: robot-assisted training might help improve UL function in stroke patients as an add-on treatment in both subacute and chronic stages. Pragmatic and highmethodological studies are needed to confirm the showed effectiveness of the exoskeleton and end-effector devices.},

Our results showed substantial variability in pressure tolerance among the participants, as well as lower pressure tolerance in females. Regarding the force applied with the exoskeleton components, male participants had higher discomfort threshold (230.3 ± 44.9 N compared to females (116.1 ± 24.6 N) in the chest area. For the applications with 20 cm2 surface, the males also showed higher pain threshold at the thigh (89.3 ± 41.8 N vs. 34.6 ± 27.2 N) and the pelvis (97.6 ± 37.0 N vs. 56.1 ± 29.5 N). All padding materials increased pressure tolerance for 10–38% (p < 0.001), but little differences between materials were observed.}

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, patients with mild and moderate upper limb paralysis caused by cerebral apoplexy are uncomfortable with autonomous rehabilitation. In this paper, according to the “rope + toothed belt” generalized rope drive design scheme, we design a utility model for a wearable upper limb rehabilitation robot with a tension mechanism. Owing to study of the human upper extremity anatomy, movement mechanisms, and the ranges of motion, it can determine the range of motion angles of the human arm joints, and design the shoulder joint, elbow joint, and wrist joint separately under the principle of ensuring the minimum driving torque. Then, the kinematics, workspace and dynamics analysis of each structure are performed. Finally, the control system of the rehabilitation robot is designed. The experimental results show that the structure is convenient to wear on the human body, and the robot’s freedom of movement matches well with the freedom of movement of the human body. It can effectively support and traction the front and rear arms of the affected limb, and accurately transmit the applied traction force to the upper limb of the joints. The rationality of the wearable upper limb rehabilitation robot design is verified, which can help patients achieve rehabilitation training and provide an effective rehabilitation equipment for patients with hemiplegia caused by stroke.},
