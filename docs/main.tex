\section{Introduction}

ArUco markers are small, square visual codes or tags designed for easy detection and identification by computer vision algorithms. They are used for camera pose
estimation and localisation. Some examples of ArUco marker usage can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:aruco_markers}. For their use in these applications, 
they need to be tracked and/or recognised, which brings out the need for robust detection and classification methods.

As \textcite{FiducialMarkerNoisy} point out, traditional detection methods perform quite well under controlled conditions, but less reliably when in real-world challenges,
such with rotations and noise. Building on that, this work explores deep learning approaches to enhance both detection and classification of ArUco markers under varying
challenging conditions.
